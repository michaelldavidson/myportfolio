                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I was born in <strong>Hamilton, Ontario, Canada</strong> and did most of my schooling there. After graduating with a B.Ed from the <strong>University of Victoria in 2007</strong>, I made my way overseas to teach English in <strong>Seoul, Korea</strong>. After that I had stops in <strong>Morogoro, Tanzania</strong> (volunteer work), <strong>London, United Kingdom</strong> (teaching) and <strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong> (teaching). Much of my teaching career has been related to IT work, including teaching children to code with scratch (and various robots). I have worked extensively with Google for Education, including becoming a <strong>Google Certified Innovator</strong> and a <strong>Google Certified Trainer</strong>. I have recently decided I would like a career change and have been studying to become a Full Stack Engineer with Codecademy. Outside of work I represented New Zealand at the World Dodgeball Championships in 2022.</p>
